## Motivation
Using social media for political discourse is a common practice for good now, especially around election time. One interesting aspect of this trend is the possibility of pulsing the publicâ€™s opinion about the elections, and that has attracted the interest of many researchers and the press. 

Users from different cultures and backgrounds post large volumes of textual comments reflecting their opinion in different aspect of life and make them available to everyone. In particular, we study the case of Twitter and focus on the 2020 US presidential elections.

US elections have a global impact and hence the elections are observed not only by the residents of the country but world.

## What is Sentiment Analysis?
Sentiment analysis is the automated mining of attitudes, opinions, and emotions from text.
The key aspect is to analyze a body of text for understanding the opinion expressed by it. Typically, we quantify this sentiment with a positive or negative value, called polarity.
The overall sentiment is often inferred as positive, neutral or negative from the sign of the polarity score ranging from -1 to 1.

## Limitations
* **Data Volume**
Volume of tweets per minute is huge. Due to limitation of hardware, storage and practicality on volume of Data, team decided to retrieve ~10K tweets per day for 11 days.

* **Population Representation** The twitter user population is not an ideal representation of the country as about only 20% of US internet users access Twitter once per month. Also 63 percent of all Twitter users worldwide are between ages 35 to 65 and the ratio of female to male Twitter users is roughly one to two.

* **Data Retrieval** Standard Twitter API allows searches against a sampling of recent Tweets published in the past 7 days only.

* **Word Classification**
Too many techniques are available to classify tweet though none shows accuracy to classify tweets correctly over 80%.
